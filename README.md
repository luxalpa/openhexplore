## About

OpenHexplore is a decompilation project of the 1998 video game [Hexplore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexplore) with the goal to modernize and improve it.

## How it works

Decompilation itself is being done step by step using Hexrays IDA Pro and transforming / renaming the code to make it more readable as well as stripping / fixing code along the way.

The **`OpenHexplore.exe`** is a modified version of the original `Hexplore.exe` that has an import to `openhexplore.dll` injected into the IAT. It also contains an X86 jmp expression as first statement in WinMain which jumps directly to the memory address of the `StartHexplore()` function in `main.cpp` .

To jump back into the original games code, `global_fns.h` contains definitions for all currently needed original functions.

## Current State

Currently only the sequence up until (including) the loading screen has been decompiled.

## Plans for the future

Use the information gathered to create a full 3D version of the project using Unity3D.

## Notes

For running and development, [**DxWnd**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/) is strongly recommended
